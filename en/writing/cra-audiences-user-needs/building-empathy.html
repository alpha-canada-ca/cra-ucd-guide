      <h1 property="name" id="wb-cont" class="gc-thickline">Building empathy</h1>

      <p>When you develop empathy for users, you can create content that solves problems, supports comprehension and improves task success.</p>

      <h2>On this page</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="#h_1">You are not your user</a></li>
        <li><a href="#h_2">Intersectionality</a></li>
        <li><a href="#h_3">Barriers</a></li>
        <li><a href="#h_4">Commitment to ongoing learning</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="h_1">You are not your user</h2>

      <p>How you use and interact with CRA services is an experience unique to you. All users will be approaching tasks with a unique background and life experiences. It is important to understand that what works well for you may be drastically different from what works well for someone else. When designing products and services for the CRA, it is vital to recognize there is no one-size-fits-all approach and you must make every effort to create inclusive and accessible experiences.</p>

      <h2 id="h_2">Intersectionality</h2>

      <p>People possess multiple, layered identities, including but not limited to: gender, race, class, ethnicity, sexual orientation and ability. </p>

      <p>Examples of intersectionality:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A user who is Black has chronic pain and limited physical mobility</li>
        <li>A user who is a single parent has a modest income, and as such, has become housing insecure</li>
        <li>A user who is South East Asian and a senior is new to Canada</li>
        <li>A user who is deaf has limited access to the internet</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Creating a product or service with only one community or ability in mind leaves out all the ways our communities and abilities can intersect. We must keep all universal, situational and specific user needs in mind to ensure equal access to our products and services. </p>

      <h2 id="h_3">Barriers</h2>

      <p>According to the <a href="https://canadagazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p1/2021/2021-02-13/html/reg2-eng.html">Accessible Canada Act</a>, a barrier is anything that prevents persons with disabilities from fully and equally participating in Canadian society. However, It is important to think of barriers not just in the context of disability, but also in terms of all CRA's users. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Some barriers are very visible, like a building without an access ramp</li>
        <li>Others barriers are less visible, like instructions written in complicated language</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Examples of barriers:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A user who works double shifts is not able to phone the call centre during operating hours for help</li>
        <li>A user experiencing homelessness doesn't know how to complete the address field on their tax return because they do not currently have a fixed address</li>
        <li>A user who is a single parent who does not have the time or resources to research and apply for benefits and credits programs</li>
        <li>A user who has their first job does not know where to start with filing their taxes</li>
        <li>A user with a modest income does not have a home computer and has difficulty accessing online services</li>
        <li>A user who is new to Canada and does not speak English or French is not able to find tax resources in their native language</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Some barriers are permanent, while others are temporary (like an injury or a short period of unemployment). </p>

      <h2 id="h_4">Commitment to ongoing learning</h2>

      <p>Much like renewing certifications as a profession evolves, we must also continue to learn about the communities around us. Language is ever evolving.</p>

      <p>When creating or updating a product or service, consider taking the time to do an <a href="../../activities/environmental-scan.html">environmental scan</a> to see what leaders in accessibility and design are recommending and creating.</p>

      <p>People choose what words work best for them, and we must respect those decisions. If you are unsure about anything in terms of referring to a particular audience or community, ask for their input. Refer to the <a href="../terminology.html">terminology page</a> for guidance on terms for specific audiences.</p>

      <p>Conducting a range of user research with people in different communities helps the CRA better understand how different people interact with our products and services. Consider updating research every 2 to 3 years on a range of activities such as:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="../../activities/heuristic-usability-evaluation.html">Heuristic usability evaluation</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://infozone.omega.dce-eir.net/english/r9999999/sa/sa09/cnt/jrn_mps_schm_prcrs-eng.html">User journey maps</a>&nbsp;<span class="label label-default">Infozone</span></li>
        <li><a href="../../activities/usability-testing.html">Usability testing</a></li>
      </ul>
