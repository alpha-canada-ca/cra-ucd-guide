			<h2>On this page</h2>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="#h_1">Use simple sentence structure</a></li>
				<li><a href="#h_2">Use short sentences and paragraphs</a></li>
				<li><a href="#h_3">Use the active voice</a></li>
				<li><a href="#h_4">Use the positive form</a></li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="h_1">Use simple sentence structure</h2>

			<p>Simple sentence structure helps the reader quickly understand the subject of the sentence and what it is
				doing.</p>

			<p>To keep sentence structure simple:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Put the subject and the verb at the beginning of the sentence</li>
				<li>Keep the subject and the verb close together</li>
				<li>Use the subject + verb + object construction</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Avoid complex and compound sentences that generally contain too much information for people to understand
				when they're scanning a page.</p>

			<details>
				<summary>Examples: Replacing complex sentence structures with simple sentence structure</summary>
				<p>
					<strong>Write</strong>: You have until April 30 to file your tax return. <br>
					<strong>Don’t write</strong>: The period of time that you have to file your tax return ends on April
					30.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Write</strong>: Learn about Canada's transportation system. Find information about using
					paved roads, bike trails, airports and ports across the country. <br>
					<strong>Don't write</strong>: Canada's vast transportation system enables millions of people each
					year to travel throughout the country, around the world, and to work and back. From this page you
					can access a wealth of transportation information related to travelling and commuting.
				</p>
			</details>

			<h2 id="h_2">Use short sentences and paragraphs</h2>

			<p>Be direct and be brief. Use as few words as possible to express an idea. By being concise, you'll help
				everyone, even specialists, complete their task.</p>

			<p>Keep sentences and paragraphs short to make them easier to scan on any screen size. People who have
				learning disabilities may find it difficult to scan and understand long sentences and paragraphs.</p>

			<p>Try to keep sentences under 20 words:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Break long sentences into shorter ones</li>
				<li>Limit each sentence to 1 idea</li>
				<li>Remove unnecessary words</li>
			</ul>

			<details>
				<summary>Examples: Using short sentences</summary>
				<p>
					<strong>Write</strong>: We received your request for funding and approved it. <br>
					<strong>Don't write</strong>: We received your request for funding, which we've thoroughly reviewed
					and approved in a timely manner.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Write</strong>: We'll consider any type of investment. <br>
					<strong>Don't write</strong>: Any type of investment will be taken into consideration.
				</p>
			</details>

			<p>Try to keep paragraphs no longer than 3 sentences:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Develop 1 main idea per paragraph</li>
				<li>Use a list to present a series of more than 2 ideas</li>
				<li>Use a short form for a long title instead of repeating it</li>
			</ul>

			<p>To make content easy to scan, sometimes paragraphs may be only 1 sentence long. </p>

			<details>
				<summary>Example: Using short paragraphs</summary>
				<p><strong>Write: </strong></p>
				<p>Your SR&ED claim will generally be processed within <strong>60&nbsp;calendar days</strong> of the
					date we receive your completed claim and your income tax return for the year.</p>

				<p>Refundable claims selected for review will generally be completed within <strong>180&nbsp;calendar
						days</strong> of the date we receive your completed claim.</p>

				<p>For detailed information about processing times, review the <a
						href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/program-service-standards.html">SR&ED
						program service standards</a>.</p>

				<p class="mrgn-tp-xl"><strong>Don't write: </strong></p>

				<p>Your SR&ED claim will generally be processed within <strong>60&nbsp;calendar days</strong> of the
					date we receive your completed claim and your income tax return for the year. Refundable claims
					selected for review will generally be completed within <strong>180&nbsp;calendar days</strong> of
					the date we receive your completed claim. For detailed information about processing times, review

			</details>

			<h2 id="h_3">Use the active voice</h2>

			<p>Sentences in the active voice are direct, clear and easier to understand. Their structure is logical and
				easy to follow because the subject is the doer of the action:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Subject (the doer) + verb (the action) + object (who/what the action is about)</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Avoid the passive voice</h3>

			<p>In a passive sentence, it may be unclear who or what is doing the action. This makes the sentence harder
				to understand. The structure of a passive sentence is:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Object + verb + subject</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Use the active voice to make it clear who is responsible for the action. </p>

			<details>
				<summary>Example: Using active voice</summary>
				<p><strong>Write:</strong> We may ask you to provide proof of citizenship. (active) <br>
					<strong>Don’t write:</strong> You may be asked to provide proof of citizenship. (passive)
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Write:</strong> You must file your returns electronically. (active) <br>
					<strong>Don’t write:</strong> Your returns must be filed electronically. (passive)
				</p>
			</details>

			<p>The passive voice is useful in some cases. For more on this topic, consult:</p>

						href="https://www.noslangues-ourlanguages.gc.ca/en/writing-tips-plus/active-voice-passive-voice-voice.html">Writing
						Tips Plus: Active voice, passive voice</a></li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="h_4">Use the positive form</h2>

			<p>Whenever possible, tell people what they may or must do instead of what they may not or must not do.
				Avoid negatives, double negatives and exceptions to exceptions.</p>

			<details>
				<summary>Examples: Using positive sentences</summary>
				<p>
					<strong>Positive:</strong> You're entitled to part of the deduction. <br>
					<strong>Negative:</strong> You're not entitled to the entire deduction.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Positive:</strong> The procedure will be effective. <br>
					<strong>Double negative:</strong> The procedure will not be ineffective.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Positive:</strong> You may claim a child born in 1972 or earlier as a dependent if they have
					a mental or
					physical disability. <br>
					<strong>Double negative:</strong> You may not claim anything for a dependent child born in 1972 or
					earlier, unless
					the child has a mental or physical disability.
				</p>

			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>Exception: When using the negative is acceptable</summary>
				<p>If something has serious consequences, you may use the negative to explain that something is not
					possible or should not be done. For example: Do <strong>not</strong> try to locate the source of
					carbon monoxide. Leave your home immediately and move to fresh air.</p>
