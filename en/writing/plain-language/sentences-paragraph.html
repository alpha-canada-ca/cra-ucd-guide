			<h2>On this page</h2>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="#h_1">Use simple sentence structure</a></li>
				<li><a href="#h_2">Use short sentences and paragraphs</a></li>
				<li><a href="#h_3">Use active voice rather than passive voice</a></li>
				<li><a href="#h_4">Use positive instead of negative sentences</a></li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="h_1">Use simple sentence structure</h2>

			<p>Simple sentence structure helps the reader quickly understand the subject of the sentence and what it is doing.</p>

			<p>To keep sentence structure simple:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Put the subject and the verb at the beginning of the sentence</li>
				<li>Keep the subject and the verb close together</li>
				<li>Use the subject + verb + object construction</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Avoid complex and compound sentences that generally contain too much information for people to understand when they're scanning a page.</p>

			<details>
				<summary>Examples: Replacing complex sentence structures with simple sentence structure</summary>
				<p>
					<strong>Write</strong>: You have until April 30 to file your tax return. <br>
					<strong>Don’t write</strong>: The period of time that you have to file your tax return ends on April 30.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Write</strong>: Learn about Canada's transportation system. Find information about using paved roads, bike trails, airports and ports across the country. <br>
					<strong>Don't write</strong>: Canada's vast transportation system enables millions of people each year to travel throughout the country, around the world, and to work and back. From this page you can access a wealth of transportation information related to travelling and commuting.
				</p>
			</details>

			<h2 id="h_2">Use short sentences and paragraphs</h2>

			<p>Be concise. Use as few words as possible to express an idea. By being concise, you'll help everyone, even specialists, complete their task.</p>

			<p>Keep sentences and paragraphs short to make them easier to scan on any screen size. People who have learning disabilities may find it difficult to scan and understand long sentences and paragraphs.</p>

			<p>Try to keep sentences under 20 words:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Break long sentences into shorter ones</li>
				<li>Limit each sentence to 1 idea</li>
				<li>Remove unnecessary words</li>
			</ul>

			<details>
				<summary>Examples: Using short sentences</summary>
				<p>
					<strong>Write</strong>: We received your request for funding and approved it. <br>
					<strong>Don't write</strong>: We received your request for funding, which we've thoroughly reviewed and approved in a timely manner.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Write</strong>: We'll consider any type of investment. <br>
					<strong>Don't write</strong>: Any type of investment will be taken into consideration.
				</p>
			</details>

			<p>Try to keep paragraphs no longer than 3 sentences:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Develop 1 main idea per paragraph</li>
				<li>Use a list to present a series of more than 2 ideas</li>
				<li>Use a short form for a long title instead of repeating it</li>
			</ul>

			<p>To make content easy to scan, sometimes paragraphs may be only 1 sentence long. </p>

			<details>
				<summary>Example: Using short paragraphs</summary>
				<p><strong>Write: </strong></p>
				<p>Your SR&ED claim will generally be processed within <strong>60&nbsp;calendar days</strong> of the date we receive your completed claim and your income tax return for the year.</p>

				<p>Refundable claims selected for review will generally be completed within <strong>180&nbsp;calendar days</strong> of the date we receive your completed claim.</p>

				<p>For detailed information about processing times, review the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/program-service-standards.html">SR&ED program service standards</a>.</p>

				<p class="mrgn-tp-xl"><strong>Don't write: </strong></p>

				<p>Your SR&ED claim will generally be processed within <strong>60&nbsp;calendar days</strong> of the date we receive your completed claim and your income tax return for the year. Refundable claims selected for review will generally be completed within <strong>180&nbsp;calendar days</strong> of the date we receive your completed claim. For detailed information about processing times, review the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/scientific-research-experimental-development-tax-incentive-program/program-service-standards.html">SR&ED program service standards</a>.</p>

			</details>

			<h2 id="h_3">Use active voice rather than passive voice</h2>

			<p>In an active sentence, the subject does the action. The sentence is clear and direct. <br>
				In a passive sentence, it may be unclear who or what is doing the action.</p>

			<p>Use the active voice to make it clear who is responsible for the action. Active voice also helps you write more concise sentences.</p>

			<details>
				<summary>Example: Using active voice</summary>
				<p>
					<strong>Active</strong>: We may ask you to provide proof of citizenship. <br>
					<strong>Passive</strong>: You may be asked to provide proof of citizenship.
				</p>
			</details>

			<h2 id="h_4">Use positive instead of negative sentences</h2>

			<p>Whenever possible, tell people what they may or must do instead of what they may not or must not do. Avoid negatives, double negatives and exceptions to exceptions.</p>

			<p>However, if something has serious consequences, you can use the negative to explain that something isn't possible or should not be done. For example: Do <strong>not</strong> try to locate the source of carbon monoxide. Leave your home immediately and move to fresh air.</p>

			<details>
				<summary>Examples: Using positive sentences</summary>
				<p><strong>Using a positive instead of a negative sentence</strong></p>
				<p>
					<strong>Write</strong>: You're entitled to part of the deduction. <br>
					<strong>Don't write</strong>: You're not entitled to the entire deduction.
				</p>
				<p class="mrgn-tp-xl"><strong>Replacing the double negative in a sentence</strong></p>
				<p>
					<strong>Write</strong>: The procedure will be effective. <br>
					<strong>Don't write</strong>: The procedure will not be ineffective.
				</p>
				<p class="mrgn-tp-xl"><strong>Using the positive for an exception</strong></p>
				<p>
					<strong>Write</strong>: You may claim a child born in 1972 or earlier as a dependent if they have a mental or physical disability. <br>
					<strong>Don't write</strong>: You may not claim anything for a dependent child born in 1972 or earlier, unless the child has a mental or physical disability.
